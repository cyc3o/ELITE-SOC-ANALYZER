          ELITE SOC ANALYZER V6.0

SOC-GRADE LOG ANALYSIS, DETECTION & REPORTING ENGINE (PYTHON)


                  OVERVIEW

![SOC DASHBOARD](https://github.com/cyc3o/ELITE-SOC-ANALYZER/blob/main/img%2Ffile_000000002f34720983474b37fdfc865c.png)

ELITE SOC ANALYZER IS A SOC-STYLE LOG ANALYSIS AND ALERTING ENGINE BUILT IN PYTHON 
DESIGNED FOR EDUCATIONAL, RESEARCH, AND PORTFOLIO PURPOSES 
THIS PROJECT HELPS USERS UNDERSTAND HOW SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (SOC) TOOLS WORK INTERNALLY, INCLUDING:

LOG INGESTION
DETECTION LOGIC
ALERT GENERATION
RISK SCORING
MITRE ATT&CK MAPPING
IOC EXTRACTION
REPORT GENERATION


❌ THIS TOOL IS NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR ENTERPRISE SIEM PLATFORMS
(SPLUNK, QRADAR, MICROSOFT SENTINEL, ELK STACK, ETC.)

             🎯 KEY OBJECTIVE
