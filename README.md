🛡️ ELITE SOC ANALYZER V4.0
🔍 SOC-GRADE LOG ANALYSIS, DETECTION & REPORTING ENGINE (PYTHON)



📊 OVERVIEW

![SOC DASHBOARD](https://github.com/cyc3o/ELITE-SOC-ANALYZER/blob/main/DASHBOARD/SOC_DASHBOARD.png)

ELITE SOC ANALYZER IS A SOC-STYLE LOG ANALYSIS AND ALERTING ENGINE BUILT IN PYTHON 
DESIGNED FOR EDUCATIONAL, RESEARCH, AND PORTFOLIO PURPOSES 
THIS PROJECT HELPS USERS UNDERSTAND HOW SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (SOC) TOOLS WORK INTERNALLY, INCLUDING:

📥 LOG INGESTION

🧠 DETECTION LOGIC

🚨 ALERT GENERATION

⚠️ RISK SCORING

🎯 MITRE ATT&CK MAPPING

🧬 IOC EXTRACTION

📑 REPORT GENERATION


❌ THIS TOOL IS NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR ENTERPRISE SIEM PLATFORMS
(SPLUNK, QRADAR, MICROSOFT SENTINEL, ELK STACK, ETC.)

🎯 KEY OBJECTIVES
🧑‍💻 LEARN REAL-WORLD SOC ANALYST & BLUE TEAM WORKFLOWS
 PRACTICE BUILDING SECURITY TOOLING USING PYTHON
 UNDERSTAND ALERT PIPELINES & SOC REPORTING LOGIC
 CREATE A REALISTIC, PORTFOLIO-READY CYBERSECURITY PROJECT
⚙️ CORE FEATURES
 LOG FILE ANALYSIS (AUTH, SYSTEM, GENERIC LOGS)
 RULE-BASED DETECTION LOGIC
 BEHAVIORAL & ANOMALY DETECTION CONCEPTS
 ALERT GENERATION WITH SEVERITY LEVELS
 MITRE ATT&CK TECHNIQUE MAPPING
 RISK & SEVERITY SCORING
 IOC EXTRACTION (IP ADDRESSES, USERS, TOR INDICATORS)
 JSON REPORT GENERATION
 CSV REPORT GENERATION
 PERSISTENT MASTER CSV (HISTORICAL ALERTS)
 IOC FEED EXPORT (JSON)
 ANALYST-FRIENDLY CLI INTERFACE
 MODULAR & CLEAN PYTHON ARCHITECTURE

🧰 INSTALLATION

📌 REQUIREMENTS
