ELITE SOC ANALYZER V4.0
SOC-GRADE LOG ANALYSIS, DETECTION & REPORTING ENGINE (PYTHON)

OVERVIEW

ELITE SOC ANALYZER IS A SOC-STYLE LOG ANALYSIS AND ALERTING ENGINE BUILT IN PYTHON
FOR EDUCATIONAL, RESEARCH, AND PORTFOLIO PURPOSES.
THIS PROJECT IS DESIGNED TO HELP USERS UNDERSTAND HOW
SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (SOC) TOOLS WORK INTERNALLY, INCLUDING:
LOG INGESTION
DETECTION LOGIC
ALERT GENERATION
RISK SCORING
MITRE ATT&CK MAPPING
IOC EXTRACTION
REPORT GENERATION

THIS TOOL IS NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR ENTERPRISE SIEM PLATFORMS
(SPLUNK, QRADAR, MICROSOFT SENTINEL, ELK STACK, ETC.)

KEY OBJECTIVES

LEARN REAL-WORLD SOC ANALYST AND BLUE TEAM WORKFLOWS
PRACTICE BUILDING SECURITY TOOLING USING PYTHON
UNDERSTAND ALERT PIPELINES AND SOC REPORTING LOGIC
CREATE A REALISTIC, PORTFOLIO-READY CYBERSECURITY PROJECT


CORE FEATURES

LOG FILE ANALYSIS (AUTH, SYSTEM, AND GENERIC LOGS)
RULE-BASED DETECTION LOGIC
BEHAVIORAL AND ANOMALY DETECTION CONCEPTS
ALERT GENERATION WITH SEVERITY LEVELS
MITRE ATT&CK TECHNIQUE MAPPING
RISK AND SEVERITY SCORING
IOC EXTRACTION (IP ADDRESSES, USERS, TOR INDICATORS)
JSON REPORT GENERATION
CSV REPORT GENERATION
PERSISTENT MASTER CSV FOR HISTORICAL ALERT STORAGE
IOC FEED EXPORT IN JSON FORMAT
ANALYST-FRIENDLY CLI INTERFACE
MODULAR AND CLEAN PYTHON ARCHITECTURE


INSTALLATION
REQUIREMENTS
PYTHON 3 OR HIGHER
USES LIGHTWEIGHT AND COMMONLY AVAILABLE PYTHON LIBRARIES
NO ENTERPRISE, CLOUD, OR PAID DEPENDENCIES REQUIRED

CLONE THE REPOSITORY


GIT CLONE https://github.com/cyc3o/ELITE-SOC-ANALYZER.git
CD ELITE-SOC-ANALYZER



HOW TO RUN

Python "SOC ENGINE/main.py"

FOLLOW THE CLI PROMPTS TO:
LOAD LOG FILES
RUN ANALYSIS
GENERATE ALERTS
EXPORT REPORTS



OUTPUT FILES

REPORTS DIRECTORY
ELITE_REPORT_*.JSON → FULL SOC ANALYSIS REPORT
ELITE_REPORT_*.CSV → PER-RUN ALERT OUTPUT
ELITE_MASTER_ALERTS.CSV → ALL ALERTS (HISTORICAL + NEW DATA)

IOC DIRECTORY
IOCS_*.JSON → EXTRACTED INDICATORS OF COMPROMISE


MITRE ATT&CK SUPPORT
ALERTS ARE MAPPED TO MITRE ATT&CK TECHNIQUES
SUPPORTS ANALYST-STYLE THREAT INVESTIGATION
DESIGNED TO HELP LEARN AND PRACTICE THE ATT&CK FRAMEWORK
