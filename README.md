ELITE SOC ANALYZER v4.0
SOC-GRADE LOG ANALYSIS, DETECTION & REPORTING ENGINE (PYTHON)

OVERVIEW

ELITE SOC ANALYZER IS A SOC-STYLE LOG ANALYSIS AND ALERTING ENGINE BUILT IN PYTHON
FOR EDUCATIONAL, RESEARCH, AND PORTFOLIO PURPOSES.
THIS PROJECT IS DESIGNED TO HELP UNDERSTAND HOW SECURITY 
OPERATIONS CENTER (SOC) TOOLS WORK INTERNALLY, INCLUDING

LOG INGESTION
DETECTION LOGIC
ALERT GENERATION
RISK SCORING
MITRE ATT&CK MAPPING
IOC EXTRACTION
REPORT GENERATION

⚠️ THIS IS NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR ENTERPRISE SIEM PLATFORMS
(SPLUNK, QRADAR, SENTINEL, ELK, ETC.)

KEY OBJECTIVES
LEARN SOC ANALYST & BLUE TEAM WORKFLOWS
PRACTICE BUILDING SECURITY TOOLING IN PYTHON
UNDERSTAND ALERT PIPELINES AND REPORTING
CREATE A REALISTIC, PORTFOLIO-READY CYBERSECURITY PROJECT

CORE FEATURES
LOG FILE ANALYSIS (AUTH, SYSTEM, GENERIC LOGS)
RULE-BASED DETECTION LOGIC
BEHAVIORAL / ANOMALY DETECTION CONCEPTS
ALERT GENERATION WITH SEVERITY LEVELS
MITRE ATT&CK TECHNIQUE MAPPING
RISK & SEVERITY SCORING
IOC EXTRACTION (IP, USERS, TOR INDICATORS)
JSON REPORT GENERATION
CSV REPORT GENERATION
PERSISTENT MASTER CSV (HISTORICAL ALERT STORAGE)
IOC FEED EXPORT (JSON)
ANALYST-FRIENDLY CLI INTERFACE
MODULAR, CLEAN PYTHON ARCHITECTURE
